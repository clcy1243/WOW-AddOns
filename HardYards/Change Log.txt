== v1.03
* When not shown, was still triggering the 'move' script
* Moved some local lists as causing memory usage to rapidly climb. Gets caught in garbage collection but would be a worry for players micro-managing computer performance.
* Localised almost everything. Achieved a large cpu performance boost.
* Fixed bug with moving Hard Yards too far from the centre of the screen
* Changing Talents now no longer gets positions, colours etc muddled

== v1.02
* Sometimes during a first time use of Hard Yards there is a long delay before the WoW server recognises we are trying to move the Hard Yards frame. Mysterious. Suspect that it is because the frame hot spot is right on top of our toon. Default position is now offset right and down a bit, clear of our toon. Seems to help.
* Sometimes Hard Yards seemed to forget the last place to which it was moved. Mysterious. To work around this I (1) removed some dead code left over from a copy/paste from one of my other AddOns, (2) explicitly (rather than assuming the default) link the relative position of the Hard Yards frame to the main game window, (3) the previous fix now forces an explicit default location rather than assuming 0,0.
* A better calculation of the 'hot' region dimensions for enabling moving. Benefits really small text sizes.
* Corrected the Class Specialization English language lookup table
* Now handles players with no specialisation (i.e. sub level 10 and any player who has unlearnt or not yet learnt one)
* We Dont Wipe AddOn support
* Show/Hide & on/off options properly differentiated and fixed
* Small change to help/about panels

== v1.01
* Sloppy naming of a variable borrowed from another of my AddOns caused fatal runtime error

== v1.00
* Initial release
