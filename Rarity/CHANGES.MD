**r677:**

> Added tracking for all collectibles obtainable from Island Expeditions (see notes below)
<br>Added item: Viable Cobra Egg (Drop: Merektha)

> Reverted a minor cosmetic change to the addon's output that had harmless, but unintended, side effects

> Looting Nok-Karosh should no longer count attempts for the Eye of Observation pet (which is a drop from Orumo the Observer)

Developer Notes:
> Since there's virtually no data on anything regarding these items right now, most estimates are little more than a wild guess. They will need to be refined in future updates.

-----

**r676:**

> Added tracking for mount: Hellfire/Felblaze Infernal (Drop: Gul'dan)
<br>Added tracking for mount: Shackled Ur'zul (Drop: Argus the Unmaker)
<br>Added tracking for mounts that will be obtainable from killing the Warfront: Arathi Highlands rares (see notes below)
<br>Added tracking for mounts obtainable from Mythic difficulty BFA dungeons

> All Warlords of Draenor raids are now considered soloable
<br>Midnight's Eternal Reins: Attumen the Huntsman is now considered soloable
<br>Updated group size estimations for various Legion raids

> Mouseover tooltips for the Assembly of Iron encounter in Ulduar should once again display tracking data for Stormforged Rune
<br>Fixed TomTom waypoint creation for some rares on Argus that previously had invalid entries
<br>Looting Frostdeep Cavedwellers in the Horde garrison should now correctly add attempts for the Riding Turtle mount

Developer Notes:
> Since there isn't any data available, it's virtually guaranteed that the drop chances for these items are wrong. They will be corrected in a future update.
<br>Defeat detection for the new rares is also not yet implemented.

**r675:**

> Added tooltip for the "Adventurer of ..." exploration achievements to all relevant rares in Kul'tiras and Zandalar

> Fixed tracking for Stormforged Rune (Drop: The Assembly of Iron)

-----

**r674:**

> Added tooltip for the "Commander of Argus" achievement to all relevant rares on Argus

> Fixed tooltip display for Fossorial Bile Larva (Profession: Skinning)

-----

**r673:**

> Installing the addon without embedded libraries is no longer possible

Developer Notes:
> This Curse/Twitch "feature" caused many bug reports and offers little tangible benefit, as it was often done in error or automatically by the Twitch client. I ultimately chose to disable it in order to reduce the time spent on providing support instead of working on bug fixes or new features
