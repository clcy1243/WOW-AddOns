    Merge in Gethe's changes.
    
    This utilizes a faux scroll frame to limit the viewable text in an attempt to reduce the performance impact of having a large number of lines in the buffer.
    
    Various tweaks to the copy_frame:
    * Now uses a template to remove the need to manually create border textures.
    * SetTopLevel(true) to prevent layering issues with other frames.
    * drag_frame now has the same points as title_bg to make moving the frame slightly more reliable
    * edit_box now has the same size as scroll_area to allow for proper text wrapping when using smaller widths.
    * additional minor tweaks as a result of the above.
