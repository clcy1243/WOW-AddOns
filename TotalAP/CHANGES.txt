## TotalAP v1.5.2 - Recent changes (3 releases)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

r26:
	Added partial translation for the Korean (koKR) locale - Since this is still incomplete (~58% done), any help is welcome!
	
	Updated database to include 7.3 AP items
	Updated Artifact Knowledge tooltip to account for the global AK progress added in 7.3
	Removed obsolete Artifact Research status info from progress bar tooltips
	Removed highlighting of Artifact Research Notes (will no longer be displayed prominently, as they are now unusable/grey vendor trash)
	Removed obscure "artifact power" items from the DB that did nothing but crash the scanning algorithm (Cookie's Old Stew... really, Blizzard!?)
	Removed obsolete artifact power items from the DB that were removed from the game some time after 7.3 (via hotfix?)
	
	Fixed number format for the Russian (ruRU) locale
	Fixed number format for the Korean (koKR) locale
	Fixed number format for the Spanish (esES and esMX) locales
	Added some workarounds that should (hopefully) prevent the remaining taint issues
	

r25:
	Added state indicators (icons) for events that would render the action button unusable or the display to be hidden (depending on the settings), such as engaging in combat, pet battles, vehicular combat, or utilizing a Flight Master's services
	
	Reworked the display (GUI) to allow further customization (in future updates). This might temporarily cause some minor problems and glitches that haven't been found yet :(
	The former /ap combat slash command is now /ap autohide and toggles the automatic hiding of the displays during all relevant events (mentioned above) instead of only detecting combat. More fine-grained settings for this are coming soon (TM)
	
	Fixed long-standing taint issues that could manifest in combat and result in seemingly random Lua errors. They were caused by relying on Blizzard's button glow effect functionality, which has been replaced entirely by a third-party library to make sure this won't be a problem in the future
	Fixed an issue where changing specializations would not re-scan the player's artifact as intended and update the display accordingly

	
r24:
	
	Artifact Research Notes and similar items (catch-up tomes for alts) will now be ignored for players that haven't reached level 110 yet

	Fixed an issue that could prevent the displays from being dragged to the very bottom of the player's interface
	Fixed an issue where dropping from an instance group could cause the detection of ignored specs to fail temporarily
	Fixed a minor graphics glitch pertaining to the buttonText, manifesting only when AP items were stored in the bank
	Fixed the broken /ap reset slash command (caused by the changes made to saved variables handling in r23)
