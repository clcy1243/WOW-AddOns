## TotalAP v1.5.5 - Recent changes (3 releases)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

r27:
	Added relic recommendations to tooltip (based on icy-veins.com - don't take them for gospel). These can be toggled with the newly-introduced /ap relics slash command

	The item tooltip now also displays the percentage that an an artifact power item will add to the currently equipped artifact (experimental)
	
	Fixed missing space between ActionButton and its text - it seems to have gone AWOL, but now it's back
	Fixed item tooltip to no longer display that "0 items" are in the player's inventory when there aren't any. It's true, but not very useful...
	Fixed /ap autohide command, which was broken by the recently implemented anti-taint measures. The display should once again hide if this is enabled
	Fixed a glitch with the vehicle StateIcon that resulted in it showing and hiding at seemingly random times
	

r26:
	Added partial translation for the Korean (koKR) locale - Since this is still incomplete (~58% done), any help is welcome!
	
	Updated database to include 7.3 AP items
	Updated Artifact Knowledge tooltip to account for the global AK progress added in 7.3
	Removed obsolete Artifact Research status info from progress bar tooltips
	Removed highlighting of Artifact Research Notes (will no longer be displayed prominently, as they are now unusable/grey vendor trash)
	Removed obscure "artifact power" items from the DB that did nothing but crash the scanning algorithm (Cookie's Old Stew... really, Blizzard!?)
	Removed obsolete artifact power items from the DB that were removed from the game some time after 7.3 (via hotfix?)
	
	Fixed number format for the Russian (ruRU) locale
	Fixed number format for the Korean (koKR) locale
	Fixed number format for the Spanish (esES and esMX) locales
	Added some workarounds that should (hopefully) prevent the remaining taint issues
	Added a workaround for the invalid artifact tier issues (this is currently being investigated further)
	

r25:
	Added state indicators (icons) for events that would render the action button unusable or the display to be hidden (depending on the settings), such as engaging in combat, pet battles, vehicular combat, or utilizing a Flight Master's services
	
	Reworked the display (GUI) to allow further customization (in future updates). This might temporarily cause some minor problems and glitches that haven't been found yet :(
	The former /ap combat slash command is now /ap autohide and toggles the automatic hiding of the displays during all relevant events (mentioned above) instead of only detecting combat. More fine-grained settings for this are coming soon (TM)
	
	Fixed long-standing taint issues that could manifest in combat and result in seemingly random Lua errors. They were caused by relying on Blizzard's button glow effect functionality, which has been replaced entirely by a third-party library to make sure this won't be a problem in the future
	Fixed an issue where changing specializations would not re-scan the player's artifact as intended and update the display accordingly
