Ethan Centaurai:
	- Add support for Polymorph: Rabbit and Polymorph: Black Cat.
	- Upvalue our database.
	- Simplify combat event handler.
	- Bump Interface number for Patch 5.4.
	- Kill off dead code.
	- Simplify the code, making it less messy and far easier to maintain.
	- Functional and working! Sort of. Currently only works with Mage Polymorph spells, more will be added over time.
	- Comment out the combat listener for now since it only throws up errors at the moment.
	- Update to latest COMBAT_LOG_EVENT_UNFILTERED arguments.
	- Remove deprecated addon metadata.
	- Convert the addon into a Plugin instead of a Module.
	- Fix line endings.
