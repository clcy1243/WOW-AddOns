    [Raider.IO] Database Refresh

commit b91ae4231dbbbad57dfe4a11f45732dd9c0c3d4a

    - The documentation forgot to add the outputFlag to the example. Zero means it will fallback to a default return player profile.

    - Adjusted a variable reference, where we overshot into the character name instead of the outputFlag before it.

    - Adjusted the best dungeon logic to avoid showing empty dungeons or invalid dungeons that have no level. It's odd situations that I think only can occur early in the expansion when so many profiles have no scores or best dungeons yet.

    - Adjusted how the guild best frame is shown, drawn, positioned and refreshed. Should work properly once more!
    
    - Readjusted the TOC file so that the client data isn't nilled later by the client.lua.

    - Adding the client files to the ignore list, as the client will update those with personal data, we should never have to push anything to those as they are empty shells.

    - No need for git to sync the changes, that come from the client, that got them from git.
