## KEYED
Keyed is an AddOn that allows you to browse your guild's Mythic+ Keystones

## Setup
Have guild members install the AddOn. It isn't possible for Keyed to "talk" to guild members who do not have the AddOn installed, so for them to show and update on the list, having the AddOn installed is a requirement.

## Commands
 + **/keyed** - will show the Keyed user interface
 + **/keyed get [player-name/all]** - will retrieve the keystone(s) of that player (or the entire guild)
 + **/keyed print [db/database]** - prints your entire player-keystone database to the chat window
